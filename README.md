## Package components

Here we have installer for Windows (32/64), Mac Installer and Linux Server and Desktop without installer.

At the moment for ubuntu you need to do more manual work, putting the server in systemd and run the executable by yourself.

There is a plan for making a pkg package for ubuntu in upcoming months (as of 2021-01)
